## Some descriptions

Pong is written oc C++ language, object-oriented based. There were used all fundamental principles of OOP: encapsulation (in class Text), inheritance and polymorphism (class Scene and so on). Only 3 patterns were used during the coding process: Singleton, Abstract Factory, Builder. STL library weren't included, since current game has a few amount of object of same "nature" (as an example, only two platforms). Running on Win32.
